# Score-Keeper
**This is my first HTML project with DOM.**  
**HOW TO PLAY?**  
This game consists of two players. Each player has a coresponding button, and a reset button which sets the game to the starting mode.  
The textfield takes the number which is to be achieved by the players, `by default-5`.   
The player who reaches the number first by clicking the button, **wins** and the game gets over by changing the color of the score of the winning player to green.
